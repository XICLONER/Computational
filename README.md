<big><big><span class="title" style="color: #5480ED">Armstrong :</big></big>

This code gets a number and told you if is it an Armstrong number or not.

### What is Armstrong numbers?
One whose sum of digits raised to the power three equals the number itself. <br>
Example: 371 is an Armstrong number because **3^ 3 + 7^ 3 + 1^ 3 = 371**

<big><big><span class="title" style="color: #5480ED">Bubble sort :</big></big>

At first, this code will ask you how many numbers do you want to enter. after you enter the number of numbers, you should enter your number, and then the code will sort the numbers by using bubble sort method and gives you result.

<big><big><span class="title" style="color: #5480ED">Convert decimal to binary :</big></big> <br>

❗️**Hint :** 
<span style="color: #DA0000">  This code able to convert numbers with maximum seven digits.</span>

### How can convert decimal numbers to binary?
If you are interested to know how these numbers are converted, this is a simple explanation about it: <br>
Take decimal number as dividend. Divide this number by 2 (2 is base of binary so divisor here). Store the remainder in an array(it will be either 0 or 1 because of divisor 2). Repeat the above two steps until the number is greater than zero.

<big><big><span class="title" style="color: #5480ED">Divisible :</big></big>

This code gets two numbers from you and says is the first number divisible by the second or not.

<hr>

<big><big><span class="title" style="color: #5480ED">Fibonacci :</big></big>

This code shows the first 32 numbers of the Fibonacci series and you can choose a number between 1 to 32, that number means how many of series you want.

<hr>

<big><big><span class="title" style="color: #5480ED">Multiplication table :</big></big>

Gets a number between 1 to 10 and shows the multiplication table for that number.

<hr>

<big><big><span class="title" style="color: #5480ED">Multiple two matrices :</big></big>

This program receives the number of rows and columns, after that gets elements from user and give them the result.

<big><big><span class="title" style="color: #5480ED">Palindrome :</big></big>


### What is Palindrome numbers?
A palindrome number is a number that reads the same backward as forward. In other words, if you reverse the digits of a palindrome number, you'll get the same number.

<hr>

<big><big><span class="title" style="color: #5480ED">Prime numbers :</big></big>


### What is Prime numbers?
A whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself.

### How this code works?
At first, you should give the program the number of numbers you want to enter, then you should enter your numbers and
at the end the program will tell you which number is prime and which one is not and also how many of numbers are prime and how many of them is not.

<hr>

<big><big><span class="title" style="color: #5480ED">Selection sort :</big></big>


At first, this code will ask you how many numbers do you want to enter. after you enter the number of numbers, you should enter your number, and then the code will sort the numbers by using selection sort method and gives you result.
